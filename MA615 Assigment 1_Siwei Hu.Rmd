Question:

A sloppy printer produces books with an average of 2 misprints per page. You want to know how many pages
in a 50 page book will have more than k misprints. Make an n x k table that shows the probability that n or fewer pages in a 50 page book will have more than k misprints.

Idea:

The quesiton asked us about the probility that n or fewer pages in a 50 page book will have more than k misprints. So we first use poission distribution with $\lambda$ = 2 to calculate the probability that each page have more than K misprints. The PDF of poission distribution is $P(x= k)=e^{-\lambda}*\frac{\lambda^k}{k!}$, so $$P(x> k)= 1- P(x\le k) = 1- \sum_{i=0}^{k}e^{-\lambda}*\frac{\lambda^k}{k!}$$

Then we got probabilities that k = 1:6 misprints each page and then we want to calculate probability that n or fewer page in a 50 page book will have more than k misprints. Since these pages are either bad pages or good pages, so we use binomial distribution to calculate these probabilities. The pdf of binomial is $P(x\leq n) = \binom{n}{k}*p^k*q^{n-k}$
We build a table as data frame and put all these probability into table
```{r}
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)
# I set there are K misprint in each page of book 
k <- c(1:6)

# use possion distribution with lamda = 2 to calculate the probability when misprint >= k in each page

misprint.k <- ppois(k,2,lower.tail = FALSE)
misprint.k
# build a table with size 50*6 and give these row and colume names to help understand
table <- as.data.frame(matrix(nrow= 50, ncol = 6,dimnames = list(c(1:50),c(1:6))))

#use a for loop and binomial distribution to calcaulate the probabilities that misprint >= k and page <=n in each in 50 rows 
for(n in 1:50){
  table[n,] <- pbinom(n,50, misprint.k,lower.tail = TRUE)
}                             
#Use Kable to set the whole table like adjusting probilities digits and showing row name or not.
table.1 = kable(x = table, digits = 10,row.names = TRUE,"html")
kable_styling(kable_input = table.1,bootstrap_options = "striped",font_size = 14)
 
```

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="A caption", out.width = '100%'}
knitr:::include_graphics("r.png")
```
